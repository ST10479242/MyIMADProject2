### 🎨 Design Considerations
- **User Interface**: 
  - Simple and intuitive layout using `LinearLayout`.
  - Focused on clarity, large buttons, and readability.
- **Navigation**: 
  - Three main screens: Main Menu → Quiz → Score and Review.
  - Seamless transitions using `Intent`s.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: 
  - Immediate response to each question (Correct/Incorrect).
  - Score is tracked in the background.
  - Final feedback and motivation message after the quiz.

### 🧰 Use of GitHub & GitHub Actions

- The project is version-controlled using **Git** and hosted on **GitHub**.
- A **GitHub Actions CI workflow** is implemented to:
  - Automatically build the app on each push to the `main` branch.
  - Run basic tests using Gradle.
  - Ensure the project compiles successfully on each update.
> GitHub Actions provides a robust way to verify the code continuously, ensuring a smooth development workflow and fewer integration errors.
